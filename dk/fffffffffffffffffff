2. Definition of the Topic
Social media bullying, or cyberbullying, is defined as the use of digital platforms to harass, threaten, or harm others. Negative behaviors such as spreading false information, sending abusive messages, sharing harmful content, or deliberately excluding individuals from online groups are involved. These actions are typically carried out via social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and Snapchat, where anonymity and reach amplify the potential for harm.

Example: "Social media bullying is understood as the act of using online platforms to intentionally harm or harass others, with the anonymity and vast audience of the digital environment being leveraged to target individuals through messages, posts, and content."
3. Reason for Selecting the Topic
The topic of social media bullying is considered highly relevant in today’s society due to the increasing use of social platforms across all age groups, particularly among teenagers and young adults. The impact of bullying, whether emotional, psychological, or even physical, is far-reaching, with individuals' mental health, self-esteem, and overall quality of life being affected. Given the growing concern over this issue, especially with the rise of platforms that encourage open interactions, it is critical that the dynamics of social media bullying be understood and that measures to prevent it are identified.

Example: "As social media continues to dominate communication, the rise in online bullying is viewed as a pressing issue that requires addressing, particularly in light of its consequences for mental health and its impact on both individuals and communities."
